# PG.Core.Maui
Maui helpers. This project represents a collection of old Xamarin Forms classes and helpers I made to aide my old apps reuse. Some of these I am leaving intact to support porting if they don't feel too obnoxious, others I'm deleting outright if I feel they are hazerdous patterns. I may comment out things and leave todos in place for areas I wish to clean up and re-write some Maui-ish code I feel needs attention. Time will tell. I've been out of the mobile game for a bit and need to brush up.
